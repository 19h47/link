# Link

> The plugin doesn't bring any kind of front end assets (like JS, shortcode, CSS), you have to do your query on your own.

Initially built for the [J'veux √™tre bonne Blog](http://www.jveuxetrebonne.com/), __Link__ is a __WordPress__ plugin for create a custom post type and a custom category associate to __Link__.
__Link__ CPT is like the good old blogroll. Blogroll isn't supported anymore in __WordPress__, it's in source code but only for backward compatibility purpose.

This is the purpose of this plugin: bring back to life blogroll! üôè

## Feature

A __Link__ can have:

- an URL, save as `link_url` in _post_meta_,

- a color, save as `link_color` in _post_meta_,

- a description, save as `link_description` in _post_meta_,

- For image the custom post type used the built in thumbnail functionality.

- The link plugin offers the possibility to order links in backoffice. Thanks to `menu_order`.

__WordPress__, since [3.5](https://make.wordpress.org/core/2012/11/30/new-color-picker-in-wp-3-5/) version, ship in its core a [color picker](https://github.com/automattic/Iris).
