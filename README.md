# Link CPT ðŸ”—

Plugin for create **Link** custom post type and a custom category. **Link** CPT is like good old blogroll. Blogroll isn't supported anymore in **WordPress**, it's in source code but only for backward compatibility purpose.

A **Link** can have a color, a link and uses thumbnail for image. 

**WordPress**, since [3.5](https://make.wordpress.org/core/2012/11/30/new-color-picker-in-wp-3-5/) version, ship in its core a [color picker](https://github.com/automattic/Iris).
